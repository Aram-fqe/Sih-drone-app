### Redis Migration Steps (When Ready)
1. Install Redis dependencies: `pip install redis channels-redis`
2. Update Django settings for Redis channels
3. Configure WebSocket routing
4. Update Flutter for WebSocket connections
5. Deploy with Redis server

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py test ai_chatbot
python simple_test.py  # Custom test script
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Test endpoints with curl or Postman
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chatbot/chat/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello AI"}'
```

### Flutter Testing
```bash
cd Sih-drone-app/flutter_app
flutter test
flutter run  # Test integration
```
